> This repo is very much work-in-progress. We are still experimenting with integration approaches as Arroyo engine rapidly evolves.

This the implementation of the `Engine` contract of [Open Data Fabric](http://opendatafabric.org/) using the [arroyo](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo) stream processing framework. It is currently in use in [kamu-cli](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli) data management tool.


## Features
TBD

More information and engine comparisons are [available here](https://docs.kamu.dev/cli/supported-engines/).


## Developing
This is a Rust-based project. You can follow similar steps as in [`kamu-cli` development guide](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md).
